## Winter Web Development Pages

This project showcases a simple, responsive web page designed with HTML and CSS. The page features a winter-themed layout that includes a navbar with links, a dynamic content section with buttons and arrows, a featured image, and social media links for engagement. The page utilizes basic CSS styling techniques such as flexbox for layout, gradients for buttons, and absolute positioning for specific elements.

Feel free to customize the content and images to match your own winter fashion brand or other creative ideas!
